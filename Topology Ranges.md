# Network Topology Overview

**Network Topology** defines how devices in a computer network are arranged. Various types, such as bus, star, and mesh, influence data flow and connectivity. It impacts performance, scalability, fault tolerance, and resource sharing. Understanding topology is crucial for efficient network management, security, and cost optimization. Choosing the right topology is essential for building a robust and efficient network infrastructure.
